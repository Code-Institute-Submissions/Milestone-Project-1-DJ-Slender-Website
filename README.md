# Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
### djslenderuk.co.uk - Website

## Description
---
In my first milestone prohject with on the code institue full stack development course, I aim is to create a responsive, mobile first approach website, using the HTML and CSS and bootstrap that I have learnt so far from this course. I have used CSS frameworks, Bootstrap and will credit them for the use of there styling. I unfortunately didn't speak with my mentor regarding the website I was going to design as, due to already having an idea from previous projects inparticular the running club. It would've potentially saved me some time with the incredible ideas knowledge and understanding he has about web desgin, if we ran through the ideas i had first with him. The scope of the projct does not include any back-end functionality, it is solely meant to be a landing page with information only, so whilst there is an enquiries page, information entered into the fields will not feed anywhere.

I choose to work own my webpage as my first project as I liked the idea of creating something unique and representive of me. I am a DJ in my spare time. So this made it easy for me to begin my project and allow people to hear my mixes (and my mixing ability) and assertain what it would be like if they were to hire me for their event. To follow me on social media and to get a little bit of a background on me, hopefully all the information provided would entice them to contact me on my enquiries page.

## UX
---

I wanted a sleek and simple design, I would like to think I'm a minimalist, so tried to incorporate that in my design. I wanted my main page to represent me with two images, a brief overview of me, and a few mixes from my mix page. The first image that is displayed would represent the slogan which is bringing music to life, having the image come towards the user upon entering the page. Below that would be a brief overview of what you could get from the site and the differnt pages available to click on the relevant sections. The final section on the landing page was a few mixes. The entire page was meant to be breif but gives enough for you to make a decision as a hiring person or for people who would like to see and hear more you can click on the relevant area. At the footer of the page I made included icons from the fontawesome site which links to my social media, which I have included on all my pages, also on all my pages is a navbar from bootstrap.

The about page is a biography page where i go in to detail about myself, how I became a DJ and why I love it. When I created the page it had the potential to be just a big section of paragraphed text. I wanted to include something creative, I had a vision for it but didn't know what it was called or where to look for it. My style on this page is thanks to Rueben (my mentor with code institue) who pointed me in the right direction of parallax designs. The idea was to break up the text with images. However, i didn't want the images to look out of place or be the main focus of the page. So using [w3school](www.w3school.com) i was able to learn how to style the page so that it had a dynamic feel. So now the text is broken up with a few images in between each paragraph with a phrase said from the biography as a quoted heading.

I created a gallery page to give users a view as to what my dj set up looks like, what different events i have dj'd at, and a few of the artists I have worked along side. I was unaware of the different thing that could be done with this page until it was highlighted by Rueben what other things I could do apart from the css hover styling. I decided to look at creating a page where the image becomes full screen rather than just the thumbnail that i chose to display the images on this page. I included modal and carousel but unfortunately the carousel was not working the way i wanted it to work so opted for just the modal.

The mixes page was the easiest page to create. The point of this page was to allow users to come to this page and have a listen to the varied genres of mixes and the different styles of mixes. This page I embeded a number of mixes from [soundcloud](www.soundcloud.com) that would demonstrate the different types of music that I play. I deceided to section it up to make it easier for the user to see what sort of music goups there was within each sub-heading. I later added color to every other section to break it up further and give it a bit more style but keeping with the theme of the site.

The enquiries page is the most basic page on my site. The enquiries page would just be a place where users could reach out to me with various queries regarding mixes and or hiring me for their event. A contact form, where they would provide their information such as full name, email and details of their enquiry once they selected the relevant radio button. The contact Similarly with the About page, this would just be split into two columns at desktop level, and one column at mobile level. The first column would contain a picture of myself and the second column would be where I would provide text.

I wanted to ensure the navigation remianed in the same place where possible (it would fall into a collapsible button at mobile level). I chose to you use oswald and lato as my fonts because I saw how well the font looked when working through the running club excerise-module. I wanted the font to look strong when a header but not corporate, or too fancy like a 5 star michelin restaurant menu. I think the greyscale has a good variey of shades and would look excellent against the white background which would allow it to look very neutral and stylish in the same. 

I used wireframes to help me decide how I was going to design my website, below are links to my wireframes images. I general stuck to my wireframes with the odd changes made here and there but overall I stuck to my wireframes, styling came and change as the project went on and the more i discussed things with Rueben my mentor.

## Technologies/Support Used
---
Below is a list of technologies I have used to create my website.
* HTML - HTML5 provided the content and the structure of my website. I tried to use semantic elements where possible to ensure the best structure.
* CSS - CSS was used to style my pages.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap was an amazing framework to use as it saved on code writing and help me with the layout of my website. I used the Nav bar the enquiries form and the modal. I used Bootstrap to assist in building a Mobile-first approach website.
* [FreeFormatter](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-formatter.html#ad-outputm) - This is my text editor. To validate code and to correct the format.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) - Git was used for version control. Allowing me to create backups whenever significant changes were made to my code.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - This is where my repository is held externally. I aslo used GitHub pages to deploy my website to link to my domain.
* [Javascript/JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - This was imported via the Bootstrap framework to enable me to create a responsive collapsible nav bar at smaller screen sizes.
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used to import specific fonts I wanted to use on my website.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Used website to impor icons for my social links.
* [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/) - To link my domain to the git hub pages ip address.


## Testing
---
I continuously tested my website throught my project on a desktop and actually on my phone. I used the web developer tools consistenly to ensure my website was responsive, firstly at mobile screen sizes, and then at larger screen sizes. I used the device feature in the dev tools to test the build on all devices available.
The automatic checks of my HTML and CSS structure were done in [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to ensure there were no errors and they were both structured correctly. I did this continuously throughout the project. To ensure that my website was responsive across different browsers, I sent the link to my friends and family so they could identify any problems they had with using the site. When I was told somebody had an issue with the about page images, i double checked with others which didnt seem to be a problem on their browsers. I then thought it was an issue with git hub so i published the page which still made no difference then I thought it was a safari issue, but that didnt seem to be the problem either. I was unable to solve that issue but the various problem solving excerises I carried out I hoped would solve the issue. I'm under the impression it is a dated device software issue. My default browser is Google Chrome, I also tested the build on Safari, Firefox, IE, Edge and Opera, although these were done periodically. Currently, the website appears and fuctions exactly as it should on all browsers.

Probleming solving issues originally proved to be very difficult, the more I worked with Reuben the more I picked up, if there was an error on my page how I would identify the problem and where to go to locate the issue, using dev tools and making the changes in Git. The more I worked with him the more it became easier to identify how to check the differnce styles, how things would look if I changed things around or added color. Paying attention to the problems section in git would also help me identify when theres a tag issue.  

## Bugs
---

There wasnt an issue I didnt encounter throughout the whole project. The most mermorable ones were very simple fixes such as closing tags. Other issues i had was `.col-6-xs` it wasnt working how i thought it was meant to until i spoke with a tutor (Tim) who directed me to Anna's bootstrap grid layout explaination on youtube (I unfortunately can not find the link now, will insert later). I realised that I was working the wrong way around. Bootstrap starts with small screens first then to large.  so had to change it to `.col-4-lg.` The other issue was the `z-index` not being included in the navbar to stop the image from covering the navbar. `.navbar-light .navbar-brand` was not picking up the color so i had to use `!important`. 

I also had an issue with the carousel inside the modal it was not proceeding forward or backwards when the icon next or previous was clicked, i checked the js, which made no difference when removing doing various changes, I checked on stack overflow and there, I asked tutors and mentors but no fix for it. I also had one issue with one user not being able to view the images on the about page I unfortunately have not been able to resolve this.

## Deployment
---

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch. In order
for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page must be named index.html. I have a domain name, which i have linked through the domain dns.

To deploy the website to GitHub pages, I followed the below steps:
* Selected the milestone-project-1 from my GitHub dashboard.
* Selected 'Settings' from the menu bar.
* From the GitHub pages section, I chose 'master branch' from the dropdown menu.
* Once selected, the page refreshed and a link was displayed in the GitHub pages section to my wesbite.
* I entered a custom url as I previous bought a domain djslender.co.uk.
* [Website Link](https://djslender.co.uk)

* To the multiple Code Institue tutors (Tim, Stephen, Anna, Michael Hayley, Igor, Cormac and the infamous RoboDuck), constantly there to help me to think more for myself and out of the box more pointing in some of the right direction, which absolutley helps me more with the right skills to problem solve independently.
* To my mentor, [Reuben Ferrante](https://github.com/arex18), for guding me through the process and offering assistance when neccesary to point me in the right direction, also, come up with some really cool suggetions.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - Used to build out wireframes for my website.
* [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - A validator used to check my HTML and CSS structure and format periodically throughout the build.
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I used this to ensure I was entering all the information required correctly in my HTML and CSS as well as creating my parallax.
* Hayley Schafer - readme.md was a great guide, helped me to structure my read.me better
* Jaime Boyd - readme.md was also a great guide with how indepth the information needs to be in the readme file.
* To the code institue mini project - Running Club, massively inspired by this, with some adaptations and using bootstrap.


#### Copied Code
As stated in the technologies used section, I used various websites to import animations and fonts etc. However, I explicitly copied code from Bootsrap for my Nav Bar  and the modal for the Gallery page, parallax for the about page from teh w3school page.
